## üó£Ô∏è Communication

Effective communication was the backbone of our two-person team throughout the project. Since we did not use a large team management platform, we kept our interactions focused and consistent using:

- **WhatsApp** and **GitHub Issues** for instant updates and task assignments.
- **Google Sheets** for sprint planning, backlog tracking, and burndown charts.
- **Weekly scrum reports** recorded in Markdown to maintain alignment and track progress.
- GitHub pull requests and code reviews to stay informed about each other‚Äôs implementation.

We held brief weekly sync-ups where we discussed:
- What was completed,
- What needed to be done next, and
- Any blockers that required coordination.

Thanks to clear and proactive communication, we avoided redundant work and delivered a seamless integration of frontend, backend, and deployment tasks.

## ‚ú® Simplicity

Simplicity was a core principle in our decision-making, especially given that our team had only two members, whereas other teams had 3‚Äì4. With limited time and manpower, we made deliberate decisions to reduce complexity and focus on delivering a fully functional, end-to-end application.

Key ways we applied simplicity:

- **We scoped down the feature set** by not implementing the RestaurantManager role, which allowed us to invest more effort into perfecting the Customer and Admin experiences.
- **Reused frontend components** like buttons, form inputs, and restaurant cards across multiple pages to avoid redundant UI work.
- **Kept API routes clean and RESTful**, ensuring predictable JSON responses and minimal overhead.
- **Simulated external services** like email and SMS confirmations instead of integrating third-party APIs, saving integration time while preserving the user experience.

This focus on simplicity helped us complete all core functionalities within deadlines, ensured a smooth deployment, and made it easy for both of us to collaborate without overlap or confusion.
